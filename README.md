# Description
Using React and CSS, I was able to built an user-friendly and responsive application. For the main webapp, 
I broke the application into three components: Home, Display Dashboard, and Cards. The home component act as the main
function such as keeping the state of the cart and the functionalty of the order bar. The second component act as the board
that contain the data, it loop through every pastries and pass the information to the last component. For the last component, 
it render a card and an order bar for every data the second component pass to it. 

# Running the Application on VSC 
1. Run 'npm install' on the terminal 
2. Run 'npm start', application should open in a new window
