Designed and built a web application that let customers order their pastries on the website.

# Description
Using React.js, CSS, and HTML, I was able to built an user-friendly and responsive application. For the main webapp, 
I broke the application into three components: Home, Display Dashboard, and Cards. The home component act as the main
function such as keeping the state of the cart and the functionality of the order bar. The second component act as the board that contain the data, it loop through every pastries and pass the information to the last component. For the last component,it render a card and an order bar for every data the second component pass to it. 

Customer Side: #
On the Home page, customers will see an aesthetically page displaying the many products the owner sell on their website. OnCustomers are able to add/remove products, see receipt and fill out the contact form on the checkout page.

Business Side: #
Business owner are required to authericated themselve and once logged in they are able to see a similar layout as the customer but with more functionalities such as a button to add to their inventory. There is a checklist button which take user to a list of customer's orders, a log out button and a home button. User are able to delete/add to their inventory and delete orders once the orders are filled.
