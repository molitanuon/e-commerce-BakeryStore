# Bakery Shop
Designed and built a web application that let customers order their pastries on the website.
<br>

# Description
Using React.js, CSS, and HTML, I was able to build a user-friendly and responsive application. For the main web app, I broke the application into three components: Home, Display Dashboard, and Cards. The home component act as the main function such as keeping the state of the cart and the functionality of the order bar. The second component act as the board that contains the data, it loops through every pastry and passes the information to the last component. For the last component, it renders a card and an order bar for every data the second component passes to it.

Customer Side: <br>
On the Home page, customers will see an aesthetic page displaying the many products the owner sells on their website. Customers are able to add/remove products, see receipts and fill out the contact form on the checkout page.
<br><br>
Business Side: <br>
Business owners are required to authenticate themselves and once logged in they are able to see a similar layout as the customer but with more functionalities such as a button to add to their inventory. There is a checklist button that takes the user to a list of customer orders, a log-out button, and a home button. Users are able to delete/add to their inventory and delete orders once the orders are filled.
